== Changelog ==

11/28/2012:  Version 1.0.1 - Updated plugin to fix problems occurring upon Pages being saved.
			~ Custom Meta info was being altered.
			~ My apologies.
			~ "Jump to - Page Edit" will use a Custom Meta Field, jump_to_page_edit.
			~ Because the selection of an option from the "Jump to - Page Edit" list does not actually require data to be saved to the current Page, the value of the Custom Meta Key 'jump_to_page_edit' does not need to be altered.

11/24/2012:  Version 1.0 submission to WordPress.org
